## MLL Dataset

---

> Mixed-lineage leukemias (MLL) are a subset of human acute lymphoblastic leukemias with a chromosomal translocation involving the mixed-lineage leukemia gene. MLL translocations are typically found in infant leukemias and in chemotherapy-induced leukemias and have a particularly poor prognosis. The original research on this dataset (Armstrong et al.) suggested, that MLL have a highly uniform and distinct pattern that clearly distinguishes them from conventional acute lymphoblastic (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemias (AML). Our classification model also shows clear separation of the three diagnostic classes (ALL, AML and MLL leukemias) based on gene expression values.
