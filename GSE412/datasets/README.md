## GSE412 (ChildALL) Dataset

---

> The childhood ALL data set (GSE412) includes gene expression information on 110 childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples. For this data set we induced models for two different classification problems. With the first model we try to distinguish between childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells based on changes in gene expression before and after treatment, regardless of the type of treatment used.
